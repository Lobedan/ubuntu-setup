Basically this adds some APT repositories and installs some packages
intended to aid in Python and django development. By default setup.sh
installs the minimum packages required to build and test
django-collector. The --extras option to setup.sh installs some
additional packages helpful in day-to-day desktop usage, like
Chromium.
